        <p>Approximately 12,500 Confederate soldiers advanced across open fields toward the Union position in what would become known as the "High Water Mark of the Confederacy" - the closest the Confederate forces ever came to military victory over the Union.</p>

        <p>The battle resulted in 23,000 Union casualties and 28,000 Confederate casualties. Lee's army retreated back to Virginia on July 4, the same day that the Union captured Vicksburg in the Western Theater.</p>

        <p>The Union victory at Gettysburg, coupled with the fall of Vicksburg, marked a major turning point in the Civil War, after which the Confederacy's prospects for independence diminished rapidly.</p>
